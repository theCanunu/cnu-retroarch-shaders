# cnu-retroarch-shaders
Just a small custom retroarch shader repository of edits and such that I made

I started messing around with RetroArch shaders and I "made my own" CRT shader. By "made my own" I mean I altered a pre-existing shader (crt-royale) and adjusted it to my tastes.
The current shader is called "cnu__crtblur.slangp"
