# cnu-retroarch-shaders
Just a small custom retroarch shader repository of edits and such that I made

I started messing around with RetroArch shaders and I "made my own" CRT shader. By "made my own" I mean I altered a pre-existing shader (crt-royale) and adjusted it to my tastes.

There are now 2 (two) shaders to choose from.
1) cnu__crt-easymode
- based on crt-easymode. much faster than #2 with nearly the same blending and quality.
2) cnu__crtblur
- left in for legacy reasons...
